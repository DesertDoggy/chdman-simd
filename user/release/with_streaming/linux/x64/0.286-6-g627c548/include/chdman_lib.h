 * long-running command), or -1.0f when the line doesn't have one (general/final
 * messages) -- callers should treat -1.0f as "no change to the last known percent".

 * writes -- keep this fast; do not call back into chdman_run from within it.

 * Runs chdman with the same command-line arguments the chdman CLI takes -- e.g.
 * createcd / extractcd / createdvd / createhd / extracthd / createraw / extractraw /
 * createld / info / verify -- exactly as documented by `chdman help <command>`.
 *
 * argv must NOT include a program name: argv[0] is the command itself (e.g. "createcd"),
 * followed by its options and values (e.g. "-i", "input.cue", "-o", "output.chd").
 * argc is the number of entries in argv. This mirrors invoking:
 *   chdman <argv[0]> <argv[1]> <argv[2]> ...
 * from the command line -- input/output paths and every other chdman option are passed
 * exactly as the CLI would take them, just as function arguments instead of a shell
 * command line.
 *
 * Returns the same exit code the chdman CLI would return (0 = success).
 *
 * on_progress, if non-NULL, is called for every line of chdman's output as it happens
 * -- see ChdmanProgressCb above. Pass NULL to skip this (e.g. for quick commands like
 * info/verify where progress isn't useful).
 *
 * All text chdman would normally print to stdout/stderr during the call is also
 * accumulated (not just delivered to on_progress) instead of being written to the real
 * streams. If out_log is non-NULL, *out_log is set to a newly allocated, null-terminated
 * buffer containing that full accumulated text (never NULL, even on success -- may be
 * an empty string). The caller owns this buffer and must release it with
 * chdman_free_log(). Pass NULL for out_log to discard the text.
 *
 * Not safe to call concurrently with itself on multiple threads at once: chdman's
 * command handlers use process-wide state (e.g. the shared CHD compressor thread
 * pool). Serialize calls, e.g. one thread per conversion.

 * calls), so cue/gdi/toc track layout is identical to a plain extract. For extractcd,
 * after the track files, the finished cue/gdi/toc sheet itself is delivered as one more
 * file (next file_index, file_name = the -o path).

 * paths, so they must be writable and not already exist (or pass -f), but every file it
 * created is deleted before returning.
